# Terraform Provider for Langfuse

A Terraform provider for managing [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) resources programmatically.

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides observability, analytics, prompt management, and evaluations for LLM applications. This provider allows you to manage organizations, projects, and API keys using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Features

- 🏢 **Organization Management** - Create and manage Langfuse organizations
- 🔑 **API Key Management** - Generate and manage organization and project API keys
- 📦 **Project Management** - Create and configure projects within organizations
- 🤖 **LLM Connections Management** - Configure and manage LLM API connections (OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex AI, etc.)
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Support** - Full support for Langfuse Enterprise features
- ⚡ **Terraform Integration** - Native integration with Terraform workflows

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.24 (for development)
- Enterprise license key (if managing organizations and organization api keys)

## Installation

### Terraform Registry (Recommended)

Add the provider to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/terraform-provider-langfuse
cd terraform-provider-langfuse

# Build the provider
go build -o terraform-provider-langfuse

```

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # Optional, defaults to https://app.langfuse.com
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key             # Optional, can use LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY env var
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY` - Admin API key (alternative to `admin_api_key`)
- `LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY` - Enterprise license key (required for admin operations)

## Usage

### Complete Example

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Variables for configuration
variable "host" {
  type        = string
  description = "Base URL of the Langfuse control plane"
  default     = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
}

variable "admin_api_key" {
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  description = "Admin API key for Langfuse (or set LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY)"
}

# Configure the provider
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = var.host
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key
}

# Create an organization
resource "langfuse_organization" "example" {
  name = "My Organization"
}

# Create organization API keys
resource "langfuse_organization_api_key" "example" {
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
}

# Create a project within the organization
resource "langfuse_project" "example" {
  name            = "my-project"
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
  retention_days  = 90  # Optional: data retention period

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Create project API keys
resource "langfuse_project_api_key" "example" {
  project_id = langfuse_project.example.id

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Output the API keys (marked as sensitive)
output "org_public_key" {
  value     = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  sensitive = true
}

output "project_secret_key" {
  value     = langfuse_project_api_key.example.secret_key
  sensitive = true
}
```

resource "langfuse_project_membership" "admin" {
  project_id               = langfuse_project.project.id
  email                    = "admin@example.com"
  role                     = "ADMIN"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.secret_key
}

# Add a user to a project as member
resource "langfuse_project_membership" "member" {
  project_id               = langfuse_project.project.id
  email                    = "member@example.com"
  role                     = "MEMBER"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key

}

# Add multiple users to a project
resource "langfuse_project_membership" "team" {
  for_each = toset([
    "dev1@example.com",
    "dev2@example.com",
    "qa@example.com"
  ])

  project_id               = langfuse_project.project.id
  email                    = each.value
  role                     = "MEMBER"
  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.org_key.secret_key
```

### `langfuse_llm_connection`

Manages LLM API connections for a Langfuse project. Supports OpenAI, Bedrock, Azure, Google Vertex AI, and custom providers. Each connection is uniquely identified by its `provider` name. Connections are upserted (created or updated) via the provider name; destroying the resource deletes the connection from Langfuse.

#### Arguments

- `project_public_key` (String, Required, Sensitive) - Project public key for authentication
- `project_secret_key` (String, Required, Sensitive) - Project secret key for authentication
- `provider_name` (String, Required, ForceNew) - Unique name for the LLM connection within the project. Changing this value destroys and recreates the resource.
- `adapter` (String, Required) - LLM adapter type. Valid values: `anthropic`, `openai`, `azure`, `bedrock`, `google-vertex-ai`, `google-ai-studio`
- `secret_key` (String, Required, Sensitive) - API key for the LLM provider
- `base_url` (String, Optional) - Custom base URL for the LLM API
- `custom_models` (List of String, Optional) - List of custom model names
- `extra_headers` (Map of String, Optional, Sensitive) - Additional HTTP headers for LLM API requests
- `with_default_models` (Bool, Optional, Computed) - Whether to include default models (defaults to true)
- `config` (String, Optional) - Adapter-specific configuration as a JSON string

#### Attributes

- `id` (String) - The unique identifier (UUID) of the LLM connection
- `adapter` (String) - The LLM adapter type
- `provider_name` (String) - The provider name
- `base_url` (String) - The base URL used
- `custom_models` (List of String) - Custom model names
- `with_default_models` (Bool) - Whether default models are included
- `config` (String) - Adapter-specific config as JSON
- `created_at` (String) - Timestamp when the connection was created
- `updated_at` (String) - Timestamp when the connection was last updated

#### Behavior

- **Upsert Semantics**: Creating or updating this resource always upserts the connection in Langfuse by provider name. Changing `provider` destroys and recreates the resource.
- **Delete**: Destroying the resource calls `DELETE /api/public/llm-connections/{id}` and removes the connection from Langfuse.
- **Write-only Fields**: Sensitive fields like `secret_key` and `extra_headers` are preserved from the plan/state and not returned by the API.
- **Config Validation**: Adapter-specific config requirements are enforced:
  - **Bedrock**: `config` must be JSON with a `region` key, e.g. `{ "region": "us-east-1" }`
  - **Google Vertex AI**: `config` may be omitted, but if provided must include a `location` key, e.g. `{ "location": "us-central1" }`
  - **Other adapters**: `config` must be null or omitted
- **Pagination**: Read operation paginates through all LLM connections to find the target provider.

#### Example Usage

```hcl
# OpenAI connection
resource "langfuse_llm_connection" "openai_prod" {
  project_public_key  = "your-project-public-key"
  project_secret_key  = "your-project-secret-key"
  provider_name       = "openai-prod"

  with_default_models = true
}

# Bedrock connection with custom config

  provider_name       = "bedrock-prod"
  adapter             = "bedrock"
  secret_key          = "AK..."
  base_url            = "https://bedrock.aws.example.com"
  custom_models       = ["my-bedrock-model"]

  adapter             = "azure"
  secret_key          = "azure-key"
  with_default_models = true
}

# Custom provider with extra headers
resource "langfuse_llm_connection" "my_gateway" {
  project_public_key  = "your-project-public-key"
  project_secret_key  = "your-project-secret-key"
  provider_name       = "my-gateway"
  adapter             = "openai"
  secret_key          = "sk-custom"
  extra_headers       = {
    "X-My-Header" = "custom-value"
